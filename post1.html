        	In 2025, software ownership seems to be a thing of the past. However, this is no new concept. Big players in the software world like Adobe have been using the subscription software model for years. Microsoft and Apple have had the operating system market in the palms of their hands for quite some time too. These big tech monopolies breed a culture of “software sloth”, and a lack of any meaningful innovation. The last few years have been full of updates with unwanted features and unavoidable AI implementation. Yet one thing stands humbly on the sidelines: open source software. In 2025, it may be our last line of defense for innovation, transparency, and user rights. But is it enough to push back the tide of subscriptions and cloud control?      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, for the uninitiated, what is OSS or open source software? Open source software is community driven software that is freely available under an open license, allowing anyone to view, modify, and redistribute its code. According to Google’s open source blog, 70% of modern software relies on open source projects. Additionally, some 90% of companies are using open source in some way or another. Needless to say, it plays a key role in our everyday lives, and with little recognition. MacOS is a shining example of this. MacOS is built on Darwin, an open source operating system similar to Unix. Darwin was originally developed in-house by Apple and was officially announced and released in 1999 under the Apple Public Source License. This allowed for anyone to take a look under the hood of MacOS and encouraged students and professionals alike to learn to develop using Apple’s ecosystem. This is a win for everyone involved; developers get a new and growing platform that provides opportunities and innovation, and Apple gets an influx of essentially free research and development. So, how has the software space changed in the last 25+ years?      </p>

      <p>
        Coming out of the 80’s and 90’s, with massively influential projects like Linus Torvald’s Linux kernel and Richard Stallman's GNU project, open source was set to see some exponential growth with the new millennium on the horizon. Over the next 10 years, projects like Firefox, Git, and Google Chrome begin to come to light. More and more tech companies recognized the benefits and chose to adopt the open source model.  However, it quickly became apparent that there was still money to be made in the world of “free” projects. Red Hat, the leading distributor for enterprise Linux, shifted gears and released access to their source code publicly, under the pretense that support would only be offered under a subscription model.  Many others shortly followed suit. Seemingly overnight, free, public software began its evolution towards the subscription model we see so widely today. Free versions became free only to non-commercial users. Businesses and commercial developers were now required to pay for access and features that were once available to anyone. Software ownership rapidly faded into the background. Most notably, Adobe in 2012 with their shift to the subscription model and their Creative Cloud. This proved to be a massive success for Adobe. Similarly as before, others took note. Soon Microsoft began adopting the subscription model. Office 365 was moved to the cloud and started offering frequent updates and cross-device support via subscription. This introduced yet another nail in the coffin of software ownership – cloud computing.       </p>
      
      <p>
        	Cloud computing has been growing exponentially. With the average person using multiple devices, the cloud provides a solution for managing your accounts and data across your phone, tablet, laptop, or any other device. Additionally, as software improves, downloads get larger and more demanding on storage. Xbox and Playstation are two notable examples of the shift towards total cloud computing. Microsoft released the Xbox One-S “All-Digital” version; a version of their flagship gaming system with no disc drive entirely. In many ways, some users may see this as an advantage. No more swapping discs, no more going to the store to buy a game. Gone are the days for the lines of excited people waiting out front of GameStop on release day. Now, gamers have immediate access to new games via the Xbox online storefront. Still, the new age of cloud computing presents new problems alongside its  benefits. With no physical ownership, consumers are vulnerable to data loss or even complete loss of support for services that were already paid for. Destiny 2, a popular shooter game, fell victim to this very issue. Destiny 2 used Google’s Stadia, a cloud gaming service released in 2019. Consumers were promised a high-quality, lag-free experience. All was well until Google announced its shutdown in the fall of 2022. This doomed many games using the service, including Destiny 2. Users with no hardware fallback experienced total data loss. Destiny’s player count went from 300k concurrent players to a mere 60k following Google’s disbandment of Stadia. But what is the bigger picture here? </p>
      
      <p>
          The push for cloud computing comes with its share of stipulations. There is no longer any ownership over the products you purchase. Additionally, there is no longer any guarantee that the product will still be available to you at any time. If companies can now pull support from their users at their discretion, what is in place to protect the rights of the end user? Moreover, if the software is closed-source or proprietary, you lose the transparency you’d get with publicly available source code or natively installed software. Yet, these cloud services are wildly successful and widely used today. The average consumer is either unaware or unconcerned with the implications of cloud computing. Convenience and ease of access has routinely eclipsed the importance of ownership. These shortcomings are thinly veiled behind new features and user-friendliness. Microsoft, Adobe, and the like, shake the metaphorical keys in the face of the consumer - distracting users with the latest features and hoping they’d ignore the flaws and complications involved with this new age software model. </p>
      
      <p>
          However, the faults of cloud computing did not go completely unnoticed. Platforms like Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform, stepped in to set a new precedent. Aiming to be a direct competitor to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc, Nextcloud recognized the areas these other services fell short. Namely, the issues with externally stored data. Nextcloud allows users to run their own cloud locally, providing the benefits of externally stored data with the added security of it being run off of your own hardware. Nextcloud effectively bridges the gap between full cloud data management and having to run an entire server room. This service has already been adopted by the European Commission and the German federal government, both who have been seeking more data sovereignty in recent times.</p>

      <p>
          So where does OSS come into play now? Today, most open source is bundled together with monetized or proprietary software. To the credit of Apple and other large tech conglomerates, this is mostly done to balance the accessibility of development and security. If the general public had access to the MacOS source code, bad actors would quickly look for ways to exploit it. This proves to be one of the biggest contentions with public source code. Additionally, that code can be deconstructed, analyzed and edited by anyone who’d like to contribute. Although community driven projects can be excellent, this lack of a controlled development environment is the Catch-22 of OSS. Without frequent monitoring from the community, projects are vulnerable to unwanted or sometimes malicious additions to their code. In 2022, a popular file archival tool for Linux called XZ Utils, was found to have a backdoor injected into the official release. The malicious code was hidden within the Github repository. This was quickly discovered and many Linux distributions rolled back to safe versions before any widespread harm. The broader implication of this is the importance of community review for OSS projects. XZ Utils was a long standing trusted project. Even these should be frequently reviewed. Additionally, it is generally good practice to use older, tested versions that can be used with more confidence. </p>

      <p>
          Overall, OSS can be an excellent resource for both developers and businesses alike. As the culture continues to shift away from software ownership, OSS becomes more important than ever. For better or for worse, OSS exists as the primary combatant of the software ownership drought. It can be a wonderful resource for developers, an invaluable asset to businesses, and provides accessible options to all. The story of open source can teach a larger lesson beyond the scope of technology; large corporations need some external force to keep the checks and balances. The nature of OSS being free allows it to provide a completely different type of competition for corporations. There is no paywall. There is no profit to be made. Only developers trying to produce a better product for the sake of innovation. This exact sentiment is how technology will continue to grow and push its bounds. User complacency is growing, and now more than ever, it is imperative for more people to explore open source alternatives. In a world increasingly defined by digital gatekeepers, OSS offers not just a toolset – but a defense for the rights of the user. But the question remains: will users finally wake up and recognize these rising issues, or will convenience continue to cast its shadow over the importance of ownership? </p>
